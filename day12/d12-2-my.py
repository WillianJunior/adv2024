# --- Day 12: Garden Groups ---

# --- Part Two ---

# Fortunately, the Elves are trying to order so much fence that they 
# qualify for a bulk discount!

# Under the bulk discount, instead of using the perimeter to calculate 
# the price, you need to use the number of sides each region has. Each 
# straight section of fence counts as a side, regardless of how long it is.

# Consider this example again:

# AAAA
# BBCD
# BBCC
# EEEC

# The region containing type A plants has 4 sides, as does each of the 
# regions containing plants of type B, D, and E. However, the more 
# complex region containing the plants of type C has 8 sides!

# Using the new method of calculating the per-region price by multiplying 
# the region's area by its number of sides, regions A through E have 
# prices 16, 16, 32, 4, and 12, respectively, for a total price of 80.

# The second example above (full of type X and O plants) would have a 
# total price of 436.

# Here's a map that includes an E-shaped region full of type E plants:

# EEEEE
# EXXXX
# EEEEE
# EXXXX
# EEEEE

# The E-shaped region has an area of 17 and 12 sides for a price of 204. 
# Including the two regions full of type X plants, this map has a total 
# price of 236.

# This map has a total price of 368:

# AAAAAA
# AAABBA
# AAABBA
# ABBAAA
# ABBAAA
# AAAAAA

# It includes two regions full of type B plants (each with 4 sides) and a 
# single region full of type A plants (with 4 sides on the outside and 8 
#     more sides on the inside, a total of 12 sides). Be especially careful 
# when counting the fence around regions like the one full of type A plants; 
# in particular, each section of fence has an in-side and an out-side, so 
# the fence does not connect across the middle of the region (where the two 
#     B regions touch diagonally). (The Elves would have used the MÃ¶bius 
#     Fencing Company instead, but their contract terms were too one-sided.)

# The larger example from before now has the following updated prices:

#     A region of R plants with price 12 * 10 = 120.
#     A region of I plants with price 4 * 4 = 16.
#     A region of C plants with price 14 * 22 = 308.
#     A region of F plants with price 10 * 12 = 120.
#     A region of V plants with price 13 * 10 = 130.
#     A region of J plants with price 11 * 12 = 132.
#     A region of C plants with price 1 * 4 = 4.
#     A region of E plants with price 13 * 8 = 104.
#     A region of I plants with price 14 * 16 = 224.
#     A region of M plants with price 5 * 6 = 30.
#     A region of S plants with price 3 * 6 = 18.

# Adding these together produces its new total price of 1206.
